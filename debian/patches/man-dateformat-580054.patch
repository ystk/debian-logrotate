 The default value is -%Y%m%d. Note that also the character separating log
 name from the extension is part of the dateformat string. The system clock
 must be set past Sep 9th 2001 for %s to work correctly.
+Note that the datestamps generated by this format must be lexically sortable
+(i.e., first the year, then the month then the day. e.g., 2001/12/01 is ok,
+but 01/12/2001 is not, since 01/11/2002 would sort lower while it is later).
+This is because when using the \fBrotate\fR option, logrotate sorts all
+rotated filenames to find out which logfiles are older and should be removed.
